<p>After months of development, we are excited to share that WP Mail SMTP 1.0 is ready (coming next week).</p>
<p>It is a complete rewrite from grounds up, but we made sure that all your settings will work as-is. You will see a new Settings UI and 3 new native provider integrations.</p>
<p>We have created a sneak peek article that has all the details, so you know exactly what&#8217;s coming next.</p>
<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/whats-coming-in-new-wp-mail-smtp-1-0/?utm_source=wpdashboard&#038;utm_campaign=amnotification\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"button button-primary\">Click Here to Read the Full Announcement &raquo;</a></p>
<p>If you have any feedback or want us to add specific integrations, please leave a comment in the announcement post above.</p>
